# Never Ending Circles
Repository for my 15-112 Term Project. Placeholder project name - "Never Ending Circles"

# TP2 How to Run the Game:
Open and run the __main__.py file to start the game.
Press enter when the title screen pops up.
Use the up and down arrow keys to move through menu options and
press enter to select that option.


When the game starts there is a 3 second countdown in which the 
circle will spin and you will not be able to input anything.
After the 3 second countdown, you can then press the 'f' key
while the circle is overlapping with the next tile and the circle
will snap onto the tile and the other circle will start moving
in circular motion. Repeat until you reach the end of the path.
Note that the camera hasn't been yet implemented so the screen
may not display the full path.
Press the 'escape' key to exit the game.

# Never Ending Circles
Repository for my 15-112 Term Project.

# TP2 How to Run the Game:
Open and run the __main__.py file to start the game.
Press enter when the title screen pops up.
Use the up and down arrow keys to move through menu options and
press enter to select that option.
After selecting start, there will be a level select menu. Use the same
menu controls to select a level.
After the level loads, press enter to start playing, there will be a
countdown timer and as soon as it reaches 0, the game starts. Be sure
to start playing as soon as the timer reaches 0 as it is designed to
reach 0 right before the circle starts overlapping the tiles.
At any time while in a level (except for during the countdown), press
the escape key to open the pause menu where you can exit to the main menu
and toggle "Invincible" mode on or off.
When "Invincible" mode is on, the circles will automatically snap onto
the tiles without the player having to input anything.
